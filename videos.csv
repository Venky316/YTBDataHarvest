Mapillai Samba

Mapillai Samba is a native variety of rice grown in Tamil Nadu that's well suited to organic farming because it is hardy and demands little or no fertilisers or pesticides. The origins of its name can be found in Tamil forklore which has it that traditionally, on his wedding day, a bridegroom (mapillai) was required to lift a heavy rock as a show of his strength and virility. To help boost his energy before the task, this rice was cooked and fed to the new son-in-law.

Along with other native varieties of rice, mapillai samba has all but disappeared from our farms and markets, making way instead for highly processed, nutritionally inferior white rice.

Mapillai Samba can be cooked as plain rice, ground into flour or made into idli, dosa, upma and pongal. It is high in fibre and associated with a host of health benefits:

Medical Uses:
digestion
Heals stomach and mouth ulcers
Improves immunity and stamina
Strengthens muscles and nerves
Supplies instant energy to the body
Increases haemoglobin content
Good for diabetics since it is has a low Glycemic Index.",19-09-2018,06:28:50,7 min 52 sec,true,415954,4233,483,0

Mapillai Samba

Mapillai Samba is a native variety of rice grown in Tamil Nadu that's well suited to organic farming because it is hardy and demands little or no fertilisers or pesticides. The origins of its name can be found in Tamil forklore which has it that traditionally, on his wedding day, a bridegroom (mapillai) was required to lift a heavy rock as a show of his strength and virility. To help boost his energy before the task, this rice was cooked and fed to the new son-in-law.

Along with other native varieties of rice, mapillai samba has all but disappeared from our farms and markets, making way instead for highly processed, nutritionally inferior white rice.

Mapillai Samba can be cooked as plain rice, ground into flour or made into idli, dosa, upma and pongal. It is high in fibre and associated with a host of health benefits:

Medical Uses:
digestion
Heals stomach and mouth ulcers
Improves immunity and stamina
Strengthens muscles and nerves
Supplies instant energy to the body
Increases haemoglobin content
Good for diabetics since it is has a low Glycemic Index.",19-09-2018,06:26:10,7 min 52 sec,true,415954,4233,483,0

ASMR (Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response) is a euphoric experience identified by a tingling sensation that triggers positive feelings, relaxation and focus. Listening to whisper voice and eating sounds are some examples that trigger ASMR. Everyone has a different ASMR triggers. I hope you find one that can help you to relax.

This is an ASMR video. To ensure all tingles please wear headphone. If you do not enjoy EATING SOUNDS and light whispers PLEASE DO NOT WATCH IT. Eating, chewing, gulping sounds ect...are done very loudly for video purposes.

Mapillai Samba

Mapillai Samba is a native variety of rice grown in Tamil Nadu that's well suited to organic farming because it is hardy and demands little or no fertilisers or pesticides. The origins of its name can be found in Tamil forklore which has it that traditionally, on his wedding day, a bridegroom (mapillai) was required to lift a heavy rock as a show of his strength and virility. To help boost his energy before the task, this rice was cooked and fed to the new son-in-law.

Along with other native varieties of rice, mapillai samba has all but disappeared from our farms and markets, making way instead for highly processed, nutritionally inferior white rice.

Mapillai Samba can be cooked as plain rice, ground into flour or made into idli, dosa, upma and pongal. It is high in fibre and associated with a host of health benefits:

Medical Uses:
digestion
Heals stomach and mouth ulcers
Improves immunity and stamina
Strengthens muscles and nerves
Supplies instant energy to the body
Increases haemoglobin content
Good for diabetics since it is has a low Glycemic Index.",19-09-2018,04:37:58,7 min 52 sec,true,415954,4233,483,0

ASMR (Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response) is a euphoric experience identified by a tingling sensation that triggers positive feelings, relaxation and focus. Listening to whisper voice and eating sounds are some examples that trigger ASMR. Everyone has a different ASMR triggers. I hope you find one that can help you to relax.

This is an ASMR video. To ensure all tingles please wear headphone. If you do not enjoy EATING SOUNDS and light whispers PLEASE DO NOT WATCH IT. Eating, chewing, gulping sounds ect...are done very loudly for video purposes.

Mapillai Samba

Mapillai Samba is a native variety of rice grown in Tamil Nadu that's well suited to organic farming because it is hardy and demands little or no fertilisers or pesticides. The origins of its name can be found in Tamil forklore which has it that traditionally, on his wedding day, a bridegroom (mapillai) was required to lift a heavy rock as a show of his strength and virility. To help boost his energy before the task, this rice was cooked and fed to the new son-in-law.

Along with other native varieties of rice, mapillai samba has all but disappeared from our farms and markets, making way instead for highly processed, nutritionally inferior white rice.

Mapillai Samba can be cooked as plain rice, ground into flour or made into idli, dosa, upma and pongal. It is high in fibre and associated with a host of health benefits:

Medical Uses:
digestion
Heals stomach and mouth ulcers
Improves immunity and stamina
Strengthens muscles and nerves
Supplies instant energy to the body
Increases haemoglobin content
Good for diabetics since it is has a low Glycemic Index.",19-09-2018,04:34:27,7 min 52 sec,true,415954,4233,483,0

ASMR (Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response) is a euphoric experience identified by a tingling sensation that triggers positive feelings, relaxation and focus. Listening to whisper voice and eating sounds are some examples that trigger ASMR. Everyone has a different ASMR triggers. I hope you find one that can help you to relax.

This is an ASMR video. To ensure all tingles please wear headphone. If you do not enjoy EATING SOUNDS and light whispers PLEASE DO NOT WATCH IT. Eating, chewing, gulping sounds ect...are done very loudly for video purposes.

Mapillai Samba

Mapillai Samba is a native variety of rice grown in Tamil Nadu that's well suited to organic farming because it is hardy and demands little or no fertilisers or pesticides. The origins of its name can be found in Tamil forklore which has it that traditionally, on his wedding day, a bridegroom (mapillai) was required to lift a heavy rock as a show of his strength and virility. To help boost his energy before the task, this rice was cooked and fed to the new son-in-law.

Along with other native varieties of rice, mapillai samba has all but disappeared from our farms and markets, making way instead for highly processed, nutritionally inferior white rice.

Mapillai Samba can be cooked as plain rice, ground into flour or made into idli, dosa, upma and pongal. It is high in fibre and associated with a host of health benefits:

Medical Uses:
digestion
Heals stomach and mouth ulcers
Improves immunity and stamina
Strengthens muscles and nerves
Supplies instant energy to the body
Increases haemoglobin content
Good for diabetics since it is has a low Glycemic Index.",19-09-2018,04:31:10,7 min 52 sec,true,415954,4233,483,0

ASMR (Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response) is a euphoric experience identified by a tingling sensation that triggers positive feelings, relaxation and focus. Listening to whisper voice and eating sounds are some examples that trigger ASMR. Everyone has a different ASMR triggers. I hope you find one that can help you to relax.

This is an ASMR video. To ensure all tingles please wear headphone. If you do not enjoy EATING SOUNDS and light whispers PLEASE DO NOT WATCH IT. Eating, chewing, gulping sounds ect...are done very loudly for video purposes.

Mapillai Samba

Mapillai Samba is a native variety of rice grown in Tamil Nadu that's well suited to organic farming because it is hardy and demands little or no fertilisers or pesticides. The origins of its name can be found in Tamil forklore which has it that traditionally, on his wedding day, a bridegroom (mapillai) was required to lift a heavy rock as a show of his strength and virility. To help boost his energy before the task, this rice was cooked and fed to the new son-in-law.

Along with other native varieties of rice, mapillai samba has all but disappeared from our farms and markets, making way instead for highly processed, nutritionally inferior white rice.

Mapillai Samba can be cooked as plain rice, ground into flour or made into idli, dosa, upma and pongal. It is high in fibre and associated with a host of health benefits:

Medical Uses:
digestion
Heals stomach and mouth ulcers
Improves immunity and stamina
Strengthens muscles and nerves
Supplies instant energy to the body
Increases haemoglobin content
Good for diabetics since it is has a low Glycemic Index.",19-09-2018,04:15:05,7 min 52 sec,true,415954,4233,483,0

ASMR (Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response) is a euphoric experience identified by a tingling sensation that triggers positive feelings, relaxation and focus. Listening to whisper voice and eating sounds are some examples that trigger ASMR. Everyone has a different ASMR triggers. I hope you find one that can help you to relax.

This is an ASMR video. To ensure all tingles please wear headphone. If you do not enjoy EATING SOUNDS and light whispers PLEASE DO NOT WATCH IT. Eating, chewing, gulping sounds ect...are done very loudly for video purposes.

Mapillai Samba

Mapillai Samba is a native variety of rice grown in Tamil Nadu that's well suited to organic farming because it is hardy and demands little or no fertilisers or pesticides. The origins of its name can be found in Tamil forklore which has it that traditionally, on his wedding day, a bridegroom (mapillai) was required to lift a heavy rock as a show of his strength and virility. To help boost his energy before the task, this rice was cooked and fed to the new son-in-law.

Along with other native varieties of rice, mapillai samba has all but disappeared from our farms and markets, making way instead for highly processed, nutritionally inferior white rice.

Mapillai Samba can be cooked as plain rice, ground into flour or made into idli, dosa, upma and pongal. It is high in fibre and associated with a host of health benefits:

Medical Uses:
digestion
Heals stomach and mouth ulcers
Improves immunity and stamina
Strengthens muscles and nerves
Supplies instant energy to the body
Increases haemoglobin content
Good for diabetics since it is has a low Glycemic Index.",01-08-2018,03:55:04,7 min 52 sec,true,415954,4233,483,0

Then the fries are fried again at a higher temperature which causes them to form the cripsy exterior.

This recipe is so flavorful that even people who usually don't like spinach will still enjoy this gravy. Spinach cooks very fast and we only want to soak the spinach leaves for a very short time in hot water. This blanching process softens the leaves and helps in making a fine paste. The perfect palak paneer should have this bright green colour to it, if you cook the spinach leaves too much or if you caramelize the onions too much then the colour will darken.

Paneer recipe / Indian cottage cheese is  very easy to make and can convert milk into paneer which can be used for many other recipes. Paneer is a very soft cheese and does not require special ingredients and enzymes. Homemade paneer involves curdling milk using an acid like citric acid / lemon juice or vinegar. The rate of curdling and the temperature of the milk determines how soft the paneer will form. 
 For the best paneer, use a moderate temperature of milk and add lemon juice slowly. Don't add too much lemon juice at once. It will form very large curds, which might be alright for making paneer cubes  but for making sweets we need very fine and soft paneer. So curdle milk very slowly and once paneer is formed cool the milk by adding some ice cubes. Thus the formed paneer will be very soft. 
Some times paneer will have some residual smell and taste of lemon juice / vinegar so rinse the paneer in some cold water to remove this flavor.

One cheat code to the lava cake is to bury a piece of chocolate into the batter before baking. This makes sure that even if over-baked the chocolaty center will be maintained.

And for cheese, the best option is fresh mozzarella cheese (for stretchiness) , it will a little hard to find. The next option would be shredded mozzarella and cheddar cheese. Usually pre-shredded cheeses are drier and will take longer to melt.

The sugar quantities I have chosen will create a mildly sweet biscuit which when combined with a sweet chocolate cream filling will be delicious.

Mozzarella is traditionally made using rennet. However in this video we are going to see making mozzarella using rennet as well as making mozzarella using vinegar. The most important thing in making mozzarella is the selection of milk. The best milk is the milk fresh from farmers which has not been pasteurized or homogenized. The next best choice is using non-homogenized but pasteurized milk. The worst case is using homogenized and ultra-pasteurized milk (which makes very hard curds leading to paneer).

The difference is also evident when melting these cheeses, the rennet made cheese melts at low temperatures and is very stretchy, the vinegar made cheese (+non-homogenized milk) does melt but takes a little longer and at a higher temperature however when homogenized milk is used in combination with vinegar it makes paneer.

Molten chocolate lava cake is one of the ultimate dessert recipes. The soft and fluffy cake at the exterior and warm and smooth chocolaty center is an absolute delight to enjoy. 
The most crucial part of this recipe is the baking time. A little too early and the cake will be under baked and a minute too late will totally lose the molten lava. Since each oven temperature varies greatly the only way to perfect this recipe is by making several batches and experimenting. One cheat code to the lava cake is to bury a piece of chocolate into the batter before baking. This makes sure that even if over-baked the chocolaty center will be maintained.

If it is too thick it will be soggy and if it is too thin then it will get burnt very fast. 2) The next factor is getting the perfect crispy smileys is the temperature of cooking oil. If the oil temperature is too low, the potatoes will absorb too much oil and if the temperature is too hot, the outside will get burnt before the middle part gets cooked.

This will also minimize the oil used in this recipe. Next prepare the onion and capsicum mixture and coat the fried idlis. Since the idlis are already cooked we don't have to leave them in the spicy mixture for too long. So turn of the heat in 2 minutes. If left for too long then the fried idlis would loose their crispiness.

After frying the bread develops this golden brown crunchy texture. The chicken stuffing can be replaced with the stuffing of your choice from vegetables, paneer, egg or meat. Serve these hot bread rolls with some ketchup or chutney.

For mincing the chicken, I have used a knife to chop it into small pieces instead of using a electric food processor because I like some texture in the bread roll. But the choice of mincing is your call. 

Tips to prevent excess oil absorption.
1) Roll the bread into thin layer this will close out the air pockets in the bread and prevent oil from seeping inside.

2) The oil temperature should be medium high. If the temperature is too low then the bread will soak up too much oil. If its too high then the outer surface will get burnt very quickly.

3) Don't fry too many pieces at once. If multiple rolls are added to a small frying pan, the oil temperature will drop which causes soggy rolls.

This mutton biryani is very addictive and once people taste this seeraga samba rice they never want to go back to basmati rice biryani. Of all the biryanis, mutton biryani has the most flavor, even in thalapakattu restaurants mutton biryani is ordered a lot more than chicken biryani.

Traditionally the mutton pieces are cooked in big pots over wood fire and once they are ready rice will be added but in order to keep the recipe easy and simple we are going to first cook the mutton pieces in pressure cooker and then add the rice and let it along with the mutton. This seeraga samba rice cooks very fast and so we are not going to use pressure to cook the rice and we are going to employ the one pot biryani method and cook the biriyani without putting on the cooker weight(pressure).

This bread roll is a quick and easy snack in which bread is rolled into a thin sheet and well seasoned chicken pieces along with onions is stuffed inside this bread pocket. After frying the bread develops this golden brown crunchy texture. The chicken stuffing can be replaced with the stuffing of your choice from vegetables, paneer, egg or meat. Serve these hot bread rolls with some ketchup or chutney.

For mincing the chicken, I have used a knife to chop it into small pieces instead of using a electric food processor because I like some texture in the bread roll. But the choice of mincing is your call. 

Tips to prevent excess oil absorption.
1) Roll the bread into thin layer this will close out the air pockets in the bread and prevent oil from seeping inside.

2) The oil temperature should be medium high. If the temperature is too low then the bread will soak up too much oil. If its too high then the outer surface will get burnt very quickly.

3) Don't fry too many pieces at once. If multiple rolls are added to a small frying pan, the oil temperature will drop which causes soggy rolls.

Paneer recipe / Indian cottage cheese is  very easy to make and can convert milk into paneer which can be used for many other recipes. Paneer is a very soft cheese and does not require special ingredients and enzymes. Homemade paneer involves curdling milk using an acid like citric acid / lemon juice or vinegar. The rate of curdling and the temperature of the milk determines how soft the paneer will form. 
 For the best paneer, use a moderate temperature of milk and add lemon juice slowly. Don't add too much lemon juice at once. It will form very large curds, which might be alright for making paneer cubes  but for making sweets we need very fine and soft paneer. So curdle milk very slowly and once paneer is formed cool the milk by adding some ice cubes. Thus the formed paneer will be very soft. 
Some times paneer will have some residual smell and taste of lemon juice / vinegar so rinse the paneer in some cold water to remove this flavor.

This is a semi gravy type of mutton masala which is a great side dish for parotta, chapathi, idli, dosa and also goes excellent with rice and biryani. In this mutton gravy we are going to use the ground up spices as ingredients instead of freshly ground masala. Hence this recipe is ideal for beginners who might not have the kitchen appliances for grinding and also this method is much faster and easier to control the taste of the recipe. The main step in this recipe is cooking the mutton pieces. We are going to cook the mutton pieces in a pressure cooker for 4 whistles (about 25 minutes if you don't have a whistle). Also don't use too much water in the pressure cooker because it will dilute out the flavor. Only add water to barely submerge the mutton pieces. Also transfer the entire contents of the pressure cooker into the pan (Don't drain the water from cooker).

This biryani is made from seeraga samba rice instead of using basmati rice. This Thalapakattu mutton biryani is very famous in the district of Dindugal. Seeraga Samba rice is easier to digest compared to basmati rice. This mutton biryani is very addictive and once people taste this seeraga samba rice they never want to go back to basmati rice biryani. Of all the biryanis, mutton biryani has the most flavor, even in thalapakattu restaurants mutton biryani is ordered a lot more than chicken biryani.

Traditionally the mutton pieces are cooked in big pots over wood fire and once they are ready rice will be added but in order to keep the recipe easy and simple we are going to first cook the mutton pieces in pressure cooker and then add the rice and let it along with the mutton. This seeraga samba rice cooks very fast and so we are not going to use pressure to cook the rice and we are going to employ the one pot biryani method and cook the biriyani without putting on the cooker weight(pressure).

Thalapakattu Biryani is only served in very few restaurants outside dindugal but now we can make this amazing recipe at home. Enjoy this tasty Dindugal Thalappakatti Mutton biryani with some onion raita and surprise your friends and family during the weekend.

The Vatha Kuzhambu is made from Sundakkai Vathal which is called as Turkey Berry in other parts of the world. The addition of this sundakkai vathal adds a unique tangy taste to the Sundakkai Vathal Kulambu. This kulambu is often served in meals right after paruppu kulambu before the round for sambar rice. 
Vatha Kulambu is also called Vathal Puli Kulambu because the tamarind extract(puli) is slowly simmered over a low flame and in the mean time the gravy extracts the flavors from the added vathal. Thus we end up with a concentrated tasty gravy for our rice.
I have used sundakkai for my vatha kulambu but you can use other types of vathal such as manathakkali vathal, vendakkai vathal, milagu vathal etc. Each of these ingredients will add a unique taste to the kulambu. Sundakkai also has a lot of health and medicinal benefits and therefore makes this recipe healthier.

But those who have enjoyed this krauvadu kulambu know that the taste is quite extraordinary. The limited availability of good quality karuvadu and the much lower appearance on restaurant menus have rendered it an exotic delicacy. 
Salt is usually added to the fish while drying so when making this gravy we have to take into account the salt content in the fish. It is always better to add little to no salt at the beginning and when the kuzhambu is almost ready then check the salt content and add accordingly. If there is too much salt then we fix the problem by adding some large  chunks of potatoes which can absorb the salt.

The Vatha Kuzhambu is made from Sundakkai Vathal which is called as Turkey Berry in other parts of the world. The addition of this sundakkai vathal adds a unique tangy taste to the Sundakkai Vathal Kulambu. This kulambu is often served in meals right after paruppu kulambu before the round for sambar rice. 
Vatha Kulambu is also called Vathal Puli Kulambu because the tamarind extract(puli) is slowly simmered over a low flame and in the mean time the gravy extracts the flavors from the added vathal. Thus we end up with a concentrated tasty gravy for our rice.
I have used sundakkai for my vatha kulambu but you can use other types of vathal such as manathakkali vathal, vendakkai vathal, milagu vathal etc. Each of these ingredients will add a unique taste to the kulambu. Sundakkai also has a lot of health and medicinal benefits and therefore makes this recipe healthier.

This is a crispy rava dosa recipe which can be used to make instant rava dosas. The fermentation time for this dosa batter is only 20 mins.

If you think the batter is watery enough still add more water. Only if the battery is too watery the holes will be formed in the dosa after the water boils off. Also mix the batter thoroughly to make it uniform between before poring the batter on to a hot tawa. Cast Iron pans work brilliantly, they give that authentic crispy golden brown color. Non-stick pans will produce dosas with less colour but will be easier to pour and flip.

Idli batter / Dosa batter is very easy to make once the ratio of rice and urad dal(ulunthu) is established. Usually for perfect dosas we use 1 : 4 (1 cup of ulunthu for 4 cups of rice) however this ratio depends on the type of rice being used. If the grains of rice are fatter (more starch content ) then this ratio would work. If the rice grains are thinner you can try 1:3 ratio (1 cup of ulunthu for 3 cups of rice). Once a ratio is finalized for a particular brand of rice we can get perfect results after that. 
For making idlis, the batter should not be fermented much so I usually make idlis during the first 2 days of making the batter. On day 3 the batter would have fermented sufficiently for making crispy dosas. Nonstick pans are easier to spread the dosa batter but the real taste and caramelized color of dosa can be achieved only in cast iron pans.

Friends now we can enjoy soft and spongy idlis and crispy dosas all made from our homemade batter. So instead of buying the dosa batter from stores we can make them right from home.

There are two variants of mysore pak the hard version and the soft ghee version, today we are going to see how to make the ghee version which is going to melt in your mouth. 

Mysore pak might be a tricky recipe but the ingredients are very simple, you need equal quantities of besan flour, ghee and sugar. Here I have taken 
1 cup besan
1 cup ghee + 1/2 cup
1 cup sugar
1/4 cup water

1) Roast the besan flour in a pan till the raw smell of the besan is gone and is replaced by a sweet aromatic smell. 

2) Melt 1 cup of ghee and slowly add the besan flour and mix vigorously to ensure that there are no lumps. 

3)In another pan melt 1 cup of sugar with 1/4 cup of water and keep stirring till you achieve a 1-string consistency.
 
4)Gradually add the ghee-besan mixture into the sugar syrup. 

5) The mixture will  thicken and will soon start setting.

6)Transfer to a greased plate and allow to cool.

7) Cut it into desired shapes.

This is the quick and instant murukku which can be made in 10 minutes. This murukku is made purely with rice flour so it is really crispy. This makes this snack recipe ideal for evenings and is a great combination with tea / coffee. 
The temperature of the cooking oil is very critical for the murukku. If the oil temperature is too low then the murukku will absorb a lot of oil and if the temperature is too high then the outside gets browned too soon before the inside gets cooked. So keeping a moderate temperature is critical to get evenly cooked and crispy murukkus.

The sugar quantities I have chosen will create a mildly sweet biscuit which when combined with a sweet chocolate cream filling will be delicious. (This sugar quantity tasted very similar to the original biscuit). If you want to serve the biscuits without the cream layer or if you have a sweet tooth then you can use a little more sugar for the biscuits.

But those who have enjoyed this krauvadu kulambu know that the taste is quite extraordinary. The limited availability of good quality karuvadu and the much lower appearance on restaurant menus have rendered it an exotic delicacy. 
Salt is usually added to the fish while drying so when making this gravy we have to take into account the salt content in the fish. It is always better to add little to no salt at the beginning and when the kuzhambu is almost ready then check the salt content and add accordingly. If there is too much salt then we fix the problem by adding some large  chunks of potatoes which can absorb the salt.

Offerings made to the Pitrus during this fortnight reach them directly as ordained by Lord Yama. Offerings reach all departed souls, whether they are directly related to those offering them or not. Those ancestors who had lost their lives in an unnatural manner or by accident or suicide would also be able to get the offerings which would not be possible at other times. Those whose death dates are not known and annual rites cannot be performed too will benefit by these offerings. Thila or sesame seeds tarpana and pinda pradhana or rice ball offerings are made to departed ancestors during the fortnight. The food offerings reach the dead through the rays of the sun.

Saturdays in this month are considered auspicious to propitiate Lord Vishnu in the form of Lord Venkateshwara to receive his wealth blessings.Purattasi is the month when the Sun will be in the sign Virgo, ruled by Mercury. According to legend, Lord Vishnu descended on the earth plane at the Tirupati Hills, in the human form as Venkateshwara during the month of Purattasi . Also, it is believed that Shani (Saturn) loses his powers in this month. Hence, worshipping Lord Vishnu on Saturdays brings you his graceful blessings and minimizes the malefic effects of Saturn.

On all Purattasi Saturdays, devotees of Vishnu observe Vrat (fasting). While some observe a partial fast throughout the month, many follow strict fasting on all Saturdays. Apart from avoiding smoking and drinking, devotees who consume non-vegetarian food eat only vegetarian food.
On every Saturday of the Purattasi month, devotees make Mavilakku (a lamp made out of rice flour, jaggery (cane sugar) and ghee).
It is believed Lord Balaji (Vishnu) smiles on the devotees through the light from Mavilakku. Observance of fasting is believed to remove impurities, which are essential for attaining the abode of the Lord. Hymns dedicated to Lord Vishnu are chanted during the occasion.

Hope you all find this video interesting. Thank you!

It is observed on full moon day in the month of Chithirai or Chaitra, corresponding in the Gregorian calendar to a day in April or May.

This is especially popular at the river Chitra in the district of Tirunelveli in Tamil Nadu, India.

For this year , I came across Vidhai Vinayakar, also known as Seed Ganapathy.Seed Ganapathy, the alternative and meaningful way to celebrate and honour our nature. Seed Ganapathy is made from mud, manure, soluble paint and, more importantly, love for a greener and cleaner environment. Buying Seed Ganapathy is not limited to preserving nature, it flourishes the environment by planting seeds that grow to form the source of our life. When Seed Ganapathy is immersed in a pot, it releases the seeds, and the dissolved soil enriched with manure and nourishments supports the seeds to germinate to a plant.

Here is the site where one can purchase Seed Ganapathy....

On all Purattasi Saturdays, devotees of Vishnu observe Vrat (fasting). While some observe a partial fast throughout the month, many follow strict fasting on all Saturdays. Apart from avoiding smoking and drinking, devotees who consume non-vegetarian food eat only vegetarian food.
On every Saturday of the Purattasi month, devotees make Mavilakku (a lamp made out of rice flour, jaggery (cane sugar) and ghee).
It is believed Lord Balaji (Vishnu) smiles on the devotees through the light from Mavilakku. Observance of fasting is believed to remove impurities, which are essential for attaining the abode of the Lord. Hymns dedicated to Lord Vishnu are chanted during the occasion.

2024, Chitra Pournanmi falls on 23rd April.

It is on Chitra Pournami that Chitra guptan, the accountant of Lord Yama, got married. Doing holy deeds on the day of Chitra Pournami is a way of telling him, to consider the small good things that we do on this day as large and the larger sins that we commit as smaller in his account.
When one undertakes the Chitra Pournami Viratham, Chitra guptan is remembered and prayed upon by offering nivedyam during the process. The nivedyam is then distributed to others and the needy.

A starter is sure to go from ‚Äúhating the pungent-smelling pickle as a child‚Äù, to acquiring a taste for it! 
This pickle‚Äôs most unusual quality is that it doesn‚Äôt use any oil, depending instead on yogurt or buttermilk to act as the key pickling agent. Making this pickle is nothing short of a ceremony!
This is a perfect side dish for curd rice/butter milk rice. At the end of a heavy meal, two or three bits of this mahali pickle helps in digestion.

Of course, the famed ‚ÄòAvakaya‚Äô stands majestic occupying the largest jar (‚Äòavakaya jaadi‚Äô) of the lot while the lesser known yet delectable pickles stored in the smaller elegant jars. In one of those jars is a gem of a pickle and a regional classic, Bellam Avakai aka Teepi Avakaya, a sweet mango pickle prepared by North Coastal Andhraites. Though Avakaaya is the most beloved mango pickle to us Andhras, folks from Krishna and Guntur districts would express their profound love for the hot fiery mango pickle varieties while the coastal Andhraites for the sweet mango pickles. If the mangoes are more sour, we just need to increase use of jaggery and vice versa. Makes a great accompaniment to curd rice and tiffins like upma. I also use it as a salad dressing by mixing with curd.

Its so simple and the taste so divine, though we cannot drink too much.
Kashayam for Acid Reflux & Gastric Problems: I have heard so many of my friends and family who have asked me a remedy for gastric issues and Acid reflux. At the entrance to your stomach is a valve, which is a ring of muscle called the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). Normally, the LES closes as soon as food passes through it. If the LES doesn't close all the way or if it opens too often, acid produced by your stomach can move up into your esophagus. This can cause symptoms such as a burning chest discomfort called heartburn. If acid reflux symptoms happen more than twice a week, you may have acid reflux disease, also known as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).
I hope this Kashayam provides all of you some relief from heartburns and any gastric problems. It is also very safe for pregnant women. 
Do try and revert when you these two drinks.Its refreshing and at the same time helps boost immunity specially during these times.

This Vadai is usually served as prasad (gods offering) in Tamil Nadu Hanuman Temples. The blend of crispness and the spice from pepper are divine. I make this milagu vadai as an offering to Lord Anjeneya on this auspicious month of Margazhi especially during Hanumath Jayanthi. With strong pepper flavor and crispy texture, this vadai is so delicious and unique.
Curd rice is a South Indian dish made with precooked rice, curd (yogurt) & tempering spices. It is more often eaten by South Indians as a part of a meal. Curd rice also known as thayir saddam & daddojanam makes a great summer food. It is eaten with a podi, papad, pickle & even topped with some pomegranate arils or raw cucumber & onions. Curd rice is also offered to gods during pooja. Temples in South India also offer this to the deities & distribute among the devotees as prasadam.

I got the opportunity to use GPC asafoetida which provides the  best-compounded asafoetida powder, super fine powder blends with all food varieties and acts as a natural flavour enhancer, easy to store and use.

This powder is used in exotic indian curries or different flavours of rice like pulao and biriyani. one such simple and multipurpose curry mix is homemade garam masala spice mix powder known for its sharp flavour and aroma. I have always been a huge fan of homemade recipes. the main reason being the flexibility it has to offer in terms of taste and flavour. for instance, if you wish to buy a ready-made garam masala mix from the grocery shop, there are multiple options. I was really surprised with the outcome and hence there was no going back to store-bought. also, the other advantage is no use of preservative chemical while preparing this. this would reduce the shelf life, but you can prepare it frequently and using a fresh spice whenever needed.

The legend has it that this interesting variation to pesarattu was invented in the canteens of State Legislative Assembly in Hyderabad. It was an off the menu secret order, frequently requested by certain MLAs in which the standard dosa filling of potatoes was replaced with a scoop of Upma. Then on, the name MLA Pesarattu stuck.

This Vadai is usually served as prasad (gods offering) in Tamil Nadu Hanuman Temples. The blend of crispness and the spice from pepper are divine. I make this milagu vadai as an offering to Lord Anjeneya on this auspicious month of Margazhi especially during Hanumath Jayanthi. With strong pepper flavor and crispy texture, this vadai is so delicious and unique.
Curd rice is a South Indian dish made with precooked rice, curd (yogurt) & tempering spices. It is more often eaten by South Indians as a part of a meal. Curd rice also known as thayir saddam & daddojanam makes a great summer food. It is eaten with a podi, papad, pickle & even topped with some pomegranate arils or raw cucumber & onions. Curd rice is also offered to gods during pooja. Temples in South India also offer this to the deities & distribute among the devotees as prasadam.

I got the opportunity to use GPC asafoetida which provides the  best-compounded asafoetida powder, super fine powder blends with all food varieties and acts as a natural flavour enhancer, easy to store and use.

2013,PLa3a5O_Lwkf5_NzY-luTmUHgBKtuOA_FY,3Dc4llXMCzc,Recipe 517: Garam Masala Powder,"Garam Masala Powder: It is one of the essential magic spice powder used in most of the Indian recipes to enhance the flavour. Every region and part of india has its own unique and custom recipe for this spice mix. This powder is used in exotic indian curries or different flavours of rice like pulao and biriyani. one such simple and multipurpose curry mix is homemade garam masala spice mix powder known for its sharp flavour and aroma. I have always been a huge fan of homemade recipes. the main reason being the flexibility it has to offer in terms of taste and flavour. for instance, if you wish to buy a ready-made garam masala mix from the grocery shop, there are multiple options. I was really surprised with the outcome and hence there was no going back to store-bought. also, the other advantage is no use of preservative chemical while preparing this. this would reduce the shelf life, but you can prepare it frequently and using a fresh spice whenever needed.

This dish is made in various ways in Indian Cuisine.Spicy and delish is this Kashmiri Dum Aloo where baby potatoes are simmered (dum cooked) in a spicy curd (yogurt) based gravy or sauce. This is a delicious recipe from the Kashmiri cuisine.Out of all the recipes I make with baby potatoes, Kashmiri dum aloo is the most repeated one. The reason being it is easy and I just need to prepare rice and a side veggie dish or salad by the side.
Jeera Rice: Rice recipes play a major role in most of the regional Indian cuisine. it can range from simple steamed rice to spice-rich biryani recipe which can be served with and without any side dish. one such simple and favourite recipe is jeera rice recipe made with long grain rice and cumin seeds.

2041,PLa3a5O_Lwkf4LXlqPhhj9igxRhlJxrEEG,3Dc4llXMCzc,Recipe 517: Garam Masala Powder,"Garam Masala Powder: It is one of the essential magic spice powder used in most of the Indian recipes to enhance the flavour. Every region and part of india has its own unique and custom recipe for this spice mix. This powder is used in exotic indian curries or different flavours of rice like pulao and biriyani. one such simple and multipurpose curry mix is homemade garam masala spice mix powder known for its sharp flavour and aroma. I have always been a huge fan of homemade recipes. the main reason being the flexibility it has to offer in terms of taste and flavour. for instance, if you wish to buy a ready-made garam masala mix from the grocery shop, there are multiple options. I was really surprised with the outcome and hence there was no going back to store-bought. also, the other advantage is no use of preservative chemical while preparing this. this would reduce the shelf life, but you can prepare it frequently and using a fresh spice whenever needed.

Tomato chutney can be served with either breakfast recipes or even with mains course like rice and roti. This chutney can be easily stored in cool and dry place for weeks. Typically, a tomato chutney is prepared from just ripe tomatoes. However, some even add onions as well while frying to make it more acidic and spicy. According to me it is a totally a different recipe and it is known as tomato onion chutney. In addition, fresh coconut or desiccated coconut is added while grinding. 
Thakkali Thokku: Tomato thokku can be easily preserved for days as it has a long shelf life when refrigerated. Perhaps, a simple and tasty pickle recipe which is quite similar to tomato-onion chutney, can be prepared easily within minutes. A spicy, tangy tomato-based pickle which can be used as side dish for steamed rice, idli or dosa and even for roti and chapathi. It is typically prepared with ripped and juicy tomatoes, very similar to mango thokku recipe.

I got the opportunity to use GPC Hing powder for these recipes. this hing powder is strong, great in fragnance and adds special value to your kitchen. Do try using this powder in your regular cooking.

Its so simple and the taste so divine, though we cannot drink too much.
Kashayam for Acid Reflux & Gastric Problems: I have heard so many of my friends and family who have asked me a remedy for gastric issues and Acid reflux. At the entrance to your stomach is a valve, which is a ring of muscle called the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). Normally, the LES closes as soon as food passes through it. If the LES doesn't close all the way or if it opens too often, acid produced by your stomach can move up into your esophagus. This can cause symptoms such as a burning chest discomfort called heartburn. If acid reflux symptoms happen more than twice a week, you may have acid reflux disease, also known as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).
I hope this Kashayam provides all of you some relief from heartburns and any gastric problems. It is also very safe for pregnant women. 
Do try and revert when you these two drinks.Its refreshing and at the same time helps boost immunity specially during these times.

2225,PLa3a5O_Lwkf5SxK4cp98jX1b50W0TNEIY,3OQC6eCzwVk,Recipe 585: Omam (Ajwain )Rasam,"Carrom seeds are a small brown coloured spice used in Indian Culinary, it has a strong flavour. Not only in cooking, but this spice is also used for its medicinal properties. They are used to prepare an aromatic, flavourful rasam. The usage of carrom seeds is more here, hence this rasam has a strong carrom seeds flavour. This rasam is a simple dish and is comfort food for the days when you are not feeling so good and need a simple humble dish to bring back your immunity and want a flavourful food. The rasam is considered a comfort food due to its basic ingredients with basic tempering and flavourful taste. This rasam has a base of carrom-cumin powder and with tomatoes, tamarind and jaggery, it has a perfect balance of sour, sweet and spice. Use less tomatoes here to get the dominant flavours of carrom seeds, which results in an aromatic and flavourful rasam.

While the lighted lamp is important for all Hindu rituals and festivals, it is indispensable for Karthigai.This festival is celebrated with great marvel in this particular place.

Every region and part of india has its own unique and custom recipe for this spice mix. This powder is used in exotic indian curries or different flavours of rice like pulao and biriyani. one such simple and multipurpose curry mix is homemade garam masala spice mix powder known for its sharp flavour and aroma. I have always been a huge fan of homemade recipes. the main reason being the flexibility it has to offer in terms of taste and flavour. for instance, if you wish to buy a ready-made garam masala mix from the grocery shop, there are multiple options. I was really surprised with the outcome and hence there was no going back to store-bought. also, the other advantage is no use of preservative chemical while preparing this. this would reduce the shelf life, but you can prepare it frequently and using a fresh spice whenever needed.

Its so simple and the taste so divine, though we cannot drink too much.
Kashayam for Acid Reflux & Gastric Problems: I have heard so many of my friends and family who have asked me a remedy for gastric issues and Acid reflux. At the entrance to your stomach is a valve, which is a ring of muscle called the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). Normally, the LES closes as soon as food passes through it. If the LES doesn't close all the way or if it opens too often, acid produced by your stomach can move up into your esophagus. This can cause symptoms such as a burning chest discomfort called heartburn. If acid reflux symptoms happen more than twice a week, you may have acid reflux disease, also known as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).
I hope this Kashayam provides all of you some relief from heartburns and any gastric problems. It is also very safe for pregnant women. 
Do try and revert when you these two drinks.Its refreshing and at the same time helps boost immunity specially during these times.

These two podis are prepared by me at home so that you can do at home as well. Kindly note , these podis aren't currently sold at Yogambals.

Pudhina has its medicinal benefits which i am sure you all are aware of. Paagarkai/Pavakkai podi is not preferred by all as it is an assumption that it would be bitter. All I would say is do try once and I am sure you will like it. 
these podis can be had by kids of all age groups.Do try and let me know how you like it. Dont forget to add my favourite ghee to it.

The festival devoted to the diety Lord Shiva, takes place specifically on Arudra or Thiruvaathirai nakshatram day during the auspicious month of Maargazhi. Coincidentally, Arudra nakshatram happens to fall on full moon day or Pournami during Maargazhi month, thus adding greater significance to this festival.
On this day, we offer our prayers and Neivedhyam to Lord Shiva by preparing Kali.
As per 2021, it is celebrated on 20th December.

Let us combine and offer our prayers to Lord Shiva to help us have peace, harmony and prosperity around.

This Vadai is usually served as prasad (gods offering) in Tamil Nadu Hanuman Temples. The blend of crispness and the spice from pepper are divine. I make this milagu vadai as an offering to Lord Anjeneya on this auspicious month of Margazhi especially during Hanumath Jayanthi. With strong pepper flavor and crispy texture, this vadai is so delicious and unique.
Curd rice is a South Indian dish made with precooked rice, curd (yogurt) & tempering spices. It is more often eaten by South Indians as a part of a meal. Curd rice also known as thayir saddam & daddojanam makes a great summer food. It is eaten with a podi, papad, pickle & even topped with some pomegranate arils or raw cucumber & onions. Curd rice is also offered to gods during pooja. Temples in South India also offer this to the deities & distribute among the devotees as prasadam.

I got the opportunity to use GPC asafoetida which provides the  best-compounded asafoetida powder, super fine powder blends with all food varieties and acts as a natural flavour enhancer, easy to store and use.
It helped in bringing a sense of great aroma and taste to the recipe.Do try and indulge in this aromatic fragrance and flavour induced Hing powder.Given below is the information where GPC Hing powder would be available along with the contact of the person to whom you can directly order.

Since mixi-jars were not available during those times , grindstones (Kaloral)were used . For churning the mixture , an iron stamper or as one would said Ulakai was used to churn the mix. Thus the name Idicha came to be known for this sambar recipe.

2411,PLa3a5O_Lwkf6HYg5mmFmjA1sfAm5NSdM7,3Dc4llXMCzc,Recipe 517: Garam Masala Powder,"Garam Masala Powder: It is one of the essential magic spice powder used in most of the Indian recipes to enhance the flavour. Every region and part of india has its own unique and custom recipe for this spice mix. This powder is used in exotic indian curries or different flavours of rice like pulao and biriyani. one such simple and multipurpose curry mix is homemade garam masala spice mix powder known for its sharp flavour and aroma. I have always been a huge fan of homemade recipes. the main reason being the flexibility it has to offer in terms of taste and flavour. for instance, if you wish to buy a ready-made garam masala mix from the grocery shop, there are multiple options. I was really surprised with the outcome and hence there was no going back to store-bought. also, the other advantage is no use of preservative chemical while preparing this. this would reduce the shelf life, but you can prepare it frequently and using a fresh spice whenever needed.

This dish is made in various ways in Indian Cuisine.Spicy and delish is this Kashmiri Dum Aloo where baby potatoes are simmered (dum cooked) in a spicy curd (yogurt) based gravy or sauce. This is a delicious recipe from the Kashmiri cuisine.Out of all the recipes I make with baby potatoes, Kashmiri dum aloo is the most repeated one. The reason being it is easy and I just need to prepare rice and a side veggie dish or salad by the side.
Jeera Rice: Rice recipes play a major role in most of the regional Indian cuisine. it can range from simple steamed rice to spice-rich biryani recipe which can be served with and without any side dish. one such simple and favourite recipe is jeera rice recipe made with long grain rice and cumin seeds.

2414,PLa3a5O_Lwkf6HYg5mmFmjA1sfAm5NSdM7,faLgwLZfAOs,Recipe 533: Tomato Chutney & Thakkali Thokku,"Tomato Chutney: A spicy and tangy sauce recipe prepared from tomatoes and other Indian spices. Tomato chutney can be served with either breakfast recipes or even with mains course like rice and roti. This chutney can be easily stored in cool and dry place for weeks. Typically, a tomato chutney is prepared from just ripe tomatoes. However, some even add onions as well while frying to make it more acidic and spicy. According to me it is a totally a different recipe and it is known as tomato onion chutney. In addition, fresh coconut or desiccated coconut is added while grinding. 
Thakkali Thokku: Tomato thokku can be easily preserved for days as it has a long shelf life when refrigerated. Perhaps, a simple and tasty pickle recipe which is quite similar to tomato-onion chutney, can be prepared easily within minutes.

You can compare jigarthada to falooda, though taste wise both are different. The assembling is very easy. but you do need to soak badam pisin overnight or for 8 to 9 hours. They increase in volume like anything and look like a jelly. So a small amount is fine. If there is extra remaining, you can refrigerate it.
Both badam pisin and nannari syrup are natural coolants. Basam pisin also keeps you full. Its also good for gaining weight and relieves constipation.

Of course, the famed ‚ÄòAvakaya‚Äô stands majestic occupying the largest jar (‚Äòavakaya jaadi‚Äô) of the lot while the lesser known yet delectable pickles stored in the smaller elegant jars. In one of those jars is a gem of a pickle and a regional classic, Bellam Avakai aka Teepi Avakaya, a sweet mango pickle prepared by North Coastal Andhraites. Though Avakaaya is the most beloved mango pickle to us Andhras, folks from Krishna and Guntur districts would express their profound love for the hot fiery mango pickle varieties while the coastal Andhraites for the sweet mango pickles. If the mangoes are more sour, we just need to increase use of jaggery and vice versa. Makes a great accompaniment to curd rice and tiffins like upma. I also use it as a salad dressing by mixing with curd.
